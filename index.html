                Happy birthday!! You thought I didn't know, did ya? I know you have birthday blues, and I don't know how what you actually want during your birthday, so I doubt you'd appreciate a light greeting from someone like me. 
				However, at the very least, know that I do care and I genuinely am glad that you were born. I usually don't think much of birthdays, but the significance of December 1 to me feels different now more than ever. Hope you enjoy your day!😁

				<p class="idea-7">Here are my unspoken accounts of you</p>
				<p class="idea-8" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">10/25/25_I can't believe she agreed to date me after all that aura loss. She was probably reluctant to agree asya "okay lang" iya response 😭. What the hell was I being awkwardly silent for. I couldn't even send her off properly. 
					<br><br>Yet again, she looked so beautiful earlier for some reason -- when did she start looking that pretty. She also gave me keychains. I don't even like keychains but I have the urge to bring them everywhere I go. 
				</p>
				<p class="idea-9" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">10/28/25_It's been two days since we started dating. I haven't been able to sleep well ever since. For some reason, the image of her eating ramen keeps appearing in my mind. It's finals week and I'm out here simping T _T
				</p>
				<p class="idea-10" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/01/25_Couldn't take it anymore. I started drawing her. Didn't think it'd look that good, but it's going well thanks to the grid technique she taught me back then.</p>
				<p class="idea-11" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/02/25_She said "okay lang" to my drawing 😭 Still, I hope I managed to make her happy even a tiny bit</p>
				<p class="idea-12" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/11/25_Istg, I always lose aura when I'm around her. Still, it made me happy she was that enthusiastic about painting with me. Also, she does not know the power she has over me when she wears girly clothes -- I could not even focus on painting that time 🙏</p>
				<p class="idea-13" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/17/25_Okay, this is weird. I usually don't dream but lately I keep dreaming about her. First was watching her do her duties as a journalist. Second was her fighting a ghoul in her apartment. And most often, like earlier, around 2 seconds before I wake up, I keep dreaming about her chatting things she will prolly never say to me 😭</p>
				<p class="idea-14" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/23/25_I probably need to start budgeting; it's been a long time since I've been on a financial deficit 🥴 Still, if she liked the movie, then that's all that matters. Also, why did I run after her just to give her beng-beng. I've been acting strangely ever since dating her.</p>
				<p class="idea-15" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/26/25_I hope her fever goes down. Still, even when sick, she works without question. She's one of the strongest people I've ever met. Screw it, I'll try harder at school and skills-learning too; she inspires me to do better. I can't keep lying down while she's always overworked.</p>
				<p class="idea-16" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">11/29/25_The more I learn about her, the more she seems like a normal girl with normal feelings rather than the undisturbed gal I always saw her as. She probably doesn't think much of it, but it makes me happy when she opens up to me like that. </p>
				<p class="idea-17" style= "padding-left: 7rem; padding-right: 7rem;">If you ever want to rant, talk about something random, or do something together, just hit me up. You can be selfish with me, y'know. I'll just be here („• ֊ •„)</p>
